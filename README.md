##Project Description:
Friend Finder project - an app leveraging node.js and express framework.
'Friend Finder' allows a user to take a survey and matches the user up with a 'best friend' based on how closely the answers match.

With this current iteration of 'Friend Finder', the friends are stored in an array rather than a back-end MySQL database.

2. In the folder where the 'friend-finder' repo is located, run 'npm i' in your terminal to install the following required packages:
    a. express
    b. path

With all those steps complete, you should be ready to run my the 'Friend Finder'!

##Where you can find help:

    b. Bootstrap Documentation
    c. jQuery POST

Many of these Google searches will return useful code from Stackoverflow that may be useful too - what others used to implement the queries and ingest the data.
