Store-front project - a CLI app leveraging node.js and relational databases in MySQL.

##Project Description:
Store-front project - a CLI app leveraging node.js and relational databases in MySQL.
'bamazon' provides a store with the necessary CLI interfaces for:
    - Customers to view selection of products and purchase if desired
    - Managers to assess the inventory, addign stock and new items when desired.
    - Supervisors to view the performance of bamazon categorized by departments.

The inventory is stored in MySQL Database and node.js along with node packages are used to inquire for, ingest, and display that data.

##Purpose of this project: 
Bamazon takes us into using a traditional database: MySQL and reinforcing what we have learned with MySQL. Bamazon teaches us how to do simple database utilization and manipulation.

##How to get started:
1. You'll need 'Node.js' and 'npm' installed on your machine
2. In the folder where the 'bamazon' repo is located, run 'npm i' in your terminal to install the following reuqired packages:
    a. inquirer
    b. mysql
    c. console.table

With all those steps complete, you should be ready to run my bamazon-app!

##Where you can find help:
If you are stuck witht his project, it is useful to utilize Google whenever you are unsure - 
    a. inquirer node package
    b. mysql node package
    c. console.table node package
    d. mySQL database relations (JOINs, GROUP BYs)

Many of these Google searches will return useful code from Stackoverflow that may be useful too - what others used to implement the queries and ingest the data.
